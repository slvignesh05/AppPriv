 App Privacy Scout is a browser-based tool designed 
to empower non-technical users to understand the privacy implications of 
mobile and web applications. By analyzing app permissions and privacy 
policies locally in the browser, it provides a color-coded risk score 
(Red/Yellow/Green) and actionable recommendations, such as disabling 
risky permissions or choosing safer app alternatives
